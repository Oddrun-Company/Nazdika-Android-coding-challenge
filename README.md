# Live Coding Challenge

We appreciate you taking the time to participate and submit a coding challenge.
In the next step, we would like you to refactor, code organization, fix bugs and issues in code or UI and add a feature to the current existing app.

The app is a live score football app with one activity that shows a
list of today's soccer matches. Feel free to give it your personal touch.
How you code is entirely up to you, with the exception
of a few limitations we would like to see. Below you will find a description of what is expected.

### Limitations:
*   use Kotlin
*   app should be refactored to a single activity app (with a single fragment by now)
*   use your favorite libraries
*   consider dependency inversion principles
*   pick your architecture from one of MVP, MVVM or MVI
*   UI performance in a large list must be acceptable


### Requested Feature
Add a sort toggle button in Toolbar that sort all matches according to their starting times.
